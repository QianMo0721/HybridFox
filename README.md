Configuration file is under `${minecraftDir}/config/hybridfix.cfg`

## How To (Server Admins)

Download HybridFix and its dependencies(MixinBooter and ConfigAnyTime) from CurseForge, drop HybridFix into `${minecraftDir}/mods` folder.

HybridFix is not required to be installed on the client side, but some features may not work without them.

## How To (Developers)

If you are developing mods, you can import HybridFix from curse maven:

Gradle(Groovy DSL):

```groovy
implementation fg.deobf("curse.maven:hybridfix-1166614:{latest_artifact_id}")
```

If you are developing plugins, you can import HybridFix jar directly:

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.wdsj</groupId>
    <artifactId>hybridfix</artifactId>
    <version>{latest_version}</version>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>PATH-TO-JAR</systemPath>
</dependency>
```

Gradle(Groovy DSL):

```groovy
compileOnly files("PATH-TO-JAR")
```

APIs are located at `io.wdsj.hybridfix.api` and `io.wdsj.hybridfix.duck.api` package.
